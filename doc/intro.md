Homeworlds AI
=============

Overview
--------

An AI for the [Looney Pyramids](http://www.looneylabs.com/looney-pyramids) game of [Homeworlds](http://www.looneylabs.com/rules/homeworlds). Written using an MCTS algorithm coded in Clojure.

The AI assumes a two player game. That's tricky enough for now.
